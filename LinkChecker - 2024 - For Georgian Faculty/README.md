/* LinkChecker Application

Created for Georgian College Faculty as they were having to manually check their online books for faulty external links

The application checks Open Library / Pressbooks, 'Webpage' or 'Digital PDF' books for faulty external links, and returns every broken link found within the application. 
As well as the total amount of bad links, along with a .txt file to send to others or for easy copy and pasting.

Programmed in Python.
